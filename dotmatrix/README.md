# Dot matrix example code

This code is based on SunFounder's Dot Matrix example, lesson 12: https://github.com/sunfounder/Sunfounder_SuperKit_Python_code_for_RaspberryPi/blob/master/12_dotMatrix.py

I created an alphabet and I changed the way it sends signals to the shift registers. This allows me to simply draw what I want in binary and display it on the display.
